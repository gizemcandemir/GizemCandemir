### Hi there :hugs:

This is **Gizem**, a UX/UI Designer with Frontend Development skills :nerd_face:

I have been working in web app development and design teams for the last six years. Meanwhile, I was also relocating to Copenhagen from Istanbul, learning Danish, and becoming a mother. As a graduate from [Hack Your Future](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/), my time is now spent on both design and frontend development tasks. I aspire to work on impactful projects and contribute to them with all my skills 😇
