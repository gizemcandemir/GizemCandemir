### Hi there :woman-raising-hand::skin-tone-2:

This is Gizem :female-technologist::skin-tone-2:, a UX/UI Designer with Frontend Development skills.

I have been working in web app development and design teams for the last six years. Meanwhile, I was also relocating to Copenhagen from Istanbul, learning Danish, and becoming a mother. As a graduate from [Hack Your Future](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/), my time is now spent on both design and frontend development tasks. I aspire to work on impactful projects and contribute to them with all my skills ðŸ˜‡

You can see my skillset and portfolio [here](https://www.notion.so/Gizem-Candemir-9ac486303ec5497c8e6cb5ecc21551d4) :hammer_and_wrench: :nail_care::skin-tone-3:

I want to work for meaning and do good for society.
- I am open to challenges, creative with technology, responsible for my work. :muscle:
- I have strong soft skills, high emotional intelligence, and empathy. :heavy_heart_exclamation_mark_ornament:

My interests are mostly related to understanding people and society ðŸ’­
'Non-violent communication' and 'unschooling' are my favorite subjects :v:
Besides, I always like to follow tips & tricks on productivity and minimalism âœ¨
